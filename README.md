# chaframe

There are so many ways to build web applications - SPA, SSR, SSG - that paired with all the different libraries, micro-frameworks, frameworks, programming languages, markup languages - it can be an absolute mind fuck. 

I have no idea how I want to build a website - this experiment will help me work that out - and try new things and hopefully learn a few things.

Initially I've got a simple chatroom app that uses web sockets and sqlite for persistence - all implemented in Python - I want to focus more on frontends rather than the back-end - this will provide me with a consistent interface giving me more info about the languages utility. In future I want to implement this in any language I'm learning or know.

The base application does use SSR to generate the HTML for the client with some jquery sprinkled in to make AJAX calls - cause the last thing I wanted to do was implement that shit in vanilla JS.

# frontends
Basically build the same thing using one of these tools

## frameworks

- [ ] svelte-kit
- [ ] next-js

## libraries/micro-frameworks or whatever you want to call them
- [ ] svelte 
- [ ] reactjs
- [ ] vuejs

## programming languages
- [ ] elm

# backends
Well if I can be arsed creating the same thing in something else.

- [ ] rust (chad)
- [ ] typescript/nodejs (beta) 
- [ ] haskell (giga-chad)
